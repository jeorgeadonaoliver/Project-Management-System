Remember to:


Set up your database connection.
Implement proper error handling and logging.
Consider security aspects (though this might be basic for a portfolio project).
Document your API endpoints and the data they exchange.
This checklist should provide a good starting point for your backend development. Focus on completing the core Employee Management tasks and then branch out to Team and Project Management based on your time and desired complexity for your portfolio. Good luck!
